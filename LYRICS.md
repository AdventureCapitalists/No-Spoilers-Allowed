## No Spoilers Allowed

```
If you get a call from me,
Some other people are listening,
So craft your words for a special agency.

To the folks who bug our phones,
I got some stuff you should know, 
So kick back and pull that wire tap real close.

Darth Vader is Skywalker's dad,
Soylent green is people, Rosebud is a sled.
Gollum was a hobbit, Edward Norton's not retarded,
Matt Damon's skull gets sprayed in The Departed.

All of the following people will die:
Dumbledore, Catlyn, Robb Stark, and Kitty Pryde.
After faking her own death, Juliet pulls a reverse.
But only after Romeo goes first.

Jesus had a baby in the Da Vinci Code,
Bruce Willis was a ghost, Chet gets turned into a choad,
Decker is a replicant, Einhorn is man,
The suspects were all part of Soze's plan.

Russell Crowe's friends were all in his beautiful mind,
Puff the Magic Dragon was a song about getting high.
Kristin shot J.R., Robert becomes  Longshanks' vassal,
And the princess is always in another castle.

River Song turns out to be The Doctor's Wife.
George guns down Gatsby before taking his own life.
The Chief is a cylon, Sheik is Zelda ninja clad,
And Cartman's mom is also his dad.

Jack and Tyler Durden are really the same guy,
Leonard was Sammy Jenkins, Arch Cummings was a spy.
The Planet of the Apes was earth all along,
And I hope the NSA enjoys this song.
